		<p> The AAPI (Asian-American and Pacific Islander) community is recently facing racist and violent attacks as the pandemic continues 
		to take a toll on citizens, especially in countries like the United States. The "Statistics & News" Page aims to give you an idea of how much the community is suffering. 
		Most of the reports and facts are taken from a nonprofit organization formed in 2020 called <a href="https://stopaapihate.org/">Stop AAPI Hate,</a> whose mission, not unlike that of this website, 
		is to offer resources to educate and report incidents related to the Stop AAPI Hate movement.</p>

					    <p> According to a report done by the <i> Pew Research Center, </i> about 4 in 10 U.S. adults believe "it has become more common for people to 
					express racist views toward Asians since the pandemic began." </p>
					    <p> From March 2020 to February 2021, the reporting center of <i> Stop AAPI Hate </i> received a staggering total of 3795 reports. 
					This represents only a fraction of the real total number of discriminatory hate incidents Asian-Americans face. </p>
					    <p> Verbal harassment (68.1%), shunning (20.5%), and physical assault (11.1%) make up the three largest proportions of the total incidents,
					according to <i> Stop AAPI Hate's </i> 2020â€“2021 National Report. </p>
