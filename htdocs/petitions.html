		<p> Want to know how else you can support the AAPI (Asian American and Pacific Islander) community without worrying about what it will cost you? The "Petitions to Sign & Info"
		page aims to give you a list of petitions dedicated to supporting those part of the community who need the help. 
		As of writing, none of the following petitions have reached their targeted number of signatures. 
		Note that donations are optional when signing a petition but not encouraged since <i> Change.org </i> uses donations to fund their website in addition to advertising petitions. 
		Sharing the petitions yourself will be more beneficial! </p>
		<p> <i> Trigger warning: This page and the petitions contain mentions of murder, police brutality, and other forms of violence. </i> </p>

Although it is optional anyway, <b> donating to <i> Change.org </i> is not encouraged. </b> </p>
                        <p> The money will go toward advertising their website instead of directly helping the petition organizers. Donating to the organizations listed in the <a href="..\htdocs\orgs.html"> "Organizations to Support" </a> page is more advisable. </p>
		                <p> Nevertheless, signing these petitions will still make a difference! Some of these petitions also have <i> GoFundMe </i> links on their pages where you can donate to the organizers themselves! </p>
